# Pre-Fixed JavaScript Files

This directory contains pre-fixed JavaScript versions of components that have persistent syntax errors when TypeScript files are automatically converted to JavaScript during the build process.

## Purpose

These files are used by the `render-build-node.sh` script to replace problematic converted files during the build process. This approach ensures that the build completes successfully without syntax errors.

## Files

- `Footer.js` - Fixes missing/mismatched JSX closing tags
- `Navbar.js` - Fixes incorrect `else:` syntax
- `PremiumModal.js` - Fixes missing parentheses in function parameter lists
- `SubscriptionCTA.js` - Fixes missing closing h2 tags
- `VideoCard.js` - Fixes export syntax and TypeScript leftovers
- `Button.js` - Fixes export syntax issues

## How It Works

During the build process, the `render-build-node.sh` script checks for the existence of this directory and its files, then copies each pre-fixed file to its corresponding location in the components directory. This happens after the TypeScript conversion but before the Next.js build runs.

## Maintenance

If you need to update any of these components:
1. Make changes to the original TypeScript file
2. Manually update the corresponding pre-fixed JavaScript file to ensure it maintains the fixes

This approach is more reliable than regex-based fixes since it ensures that the exact correct version is used during builds.
